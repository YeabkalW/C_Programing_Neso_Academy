/**
 * Important takeaways 
 * 
 * in most of the programing languages, static scoping
 * is followed instead of dynamic scoping 
 * 
 * languages, including Algol, Pascal, C, Haskell, Scheme etc.are 
 * statically scoped.
 * 
 * Some languages, including SNOBOL, APL, Lisp etc are dynamically scoped
 * 
 * as C follows static scoping therefore it is not possible to see programmatically
 * how dynamic scoping works in C.
